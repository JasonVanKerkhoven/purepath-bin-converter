# Purpose
Converts the `.cfg` file generated by TI's Purepath DSP setup software into a `.bin` file for upload to a TI audio DAC with a small embedded DSP (uploaded using Volumio 2.0).



# Using with GUI
Simply run the `converter.jar` file.
This can be done by simply double clicking the icon in any file explorer, or through launcing in terminal with no arguments as: `java -jar converter.jar`

Type the **full** file path for the `.cfg` file in the input text field, or, click the *input* button to select the `.cfg` file using a file explorer.
The location for the `.bin` file will automatically be set to the same path as the `.cfg` file. The `.bin` file name will be the same as the `.cfg` file by default. To change this, either enter the full path/file name for the desired `.bin` file, or select the *output* button and select the destination folder.

If an error occurs during a conversion, both the line number of the error, and an error message will be displayed to the screen.



# Using With Terminal
Run the converter program using the command: `java -jar converter.jar PATH`
In which *PATH* is the **full** file path of the `.cfg` file.
The `.bin` file will be written at the same location as the `.cfg` file, with an identicle name.

If an error occurs during a conversion, both the line number of the error, and an error message will be displayed to the screen.
